This Module is based on the WF-Downloads 2.05a Module.
We have fixed many bugs and deleted some features, on the other hand we have some interesting new features in it.
This new features make it easier for you to administrate the module.
This Module is specially done for the use with Links.

You can update from weblinks or My-Links to PD-Links, all you have to do is to call the update.php that is in your pdlinks folder - IMPORTANT you cant run the script in the folder update directly, you have to start the update.php.
As always you should do a backup before updating, after the update-process was successfull you have to uninstall my-links or weblinks - after that update weblinks or my-links are unable to run anymore.
